Here's a pile of Solidworks files.

Module Assembly.sldasm is the motor, gearbox, and controller assembly
Motor.sldasm is just the motor, with the modified shaft, just some 6mm precision shaft from McMaster.  The original can be easily pressed out and a new one pressed in with a small arbor press
Gearbox Assembly.sldasm is just the gearbox
Leg Assembly.sldasm is two motor modules plus the leg links in an assembly.

Many parts have the HSMWorks cam in them, which you won't be able to use without the full version of HSMWorks.
